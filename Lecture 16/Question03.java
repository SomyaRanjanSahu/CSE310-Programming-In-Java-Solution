/* 

In a switch statement when a break; is not used under a case, a fall-through happens.

Meaning when the value matches such a case, the control flow will execute the statements under that case and will continue to execute other cases present under it until it encounters a break; statement.

For example, click on the Submit without making any changes to the below code to observe the fall-through. Observe the output when 1, 2, 3, 4 or 10 is passed.

In the below program, class FallThroughDemo is passed an integer argument into its main(...) method.

The code in the main(...) method converts the first argument available in args[0] into an integer value and uses it in the switch statement.

In the program given below, add break; statements appropriately inside the switch statement such that when :
 1 is passed, the code should print
One
Two
Three
 2 is passed, the code should print
Two
Three
 3 is passed, the code should print
Three
 4 is passed, the code should print
Four
 10 is passed, the code should print
Ten
 any other number except 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10 is passed, the code should print
Some other number


Note: Please don't change the package name.
