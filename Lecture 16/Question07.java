/* 

Write a class PrintEvenNumbers with a public method printEvenNumbers that takes one parameter arr of type int[].

Write code using for-each loop to iterate over the arr if the number is even the program should print is even otherwise, it should print is not even.

Here is an example:
Cmd Args : 13 14 15
13 is not even
14 is even
15 is not even
Hint: You can use value % 2 == 0. Meaning, you can use the modulus operator (%) to divide a number by 2 and get the remainder, to verify if the reminder is equal to 0.



Note: Please don't change the package name.
