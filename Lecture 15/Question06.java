/* 

Create a class PrintDiff with a public method computeDiff that takes two parameters firstNo and secondNo are of type int.

Calculate the difference between firstNo and secondNo. If the value of the difference is in between -25 and 25, the program should double the value and print the output, otherwise it should print the difference as it is.

For example:
Cmd Args : 15 7
16


Note: Please don't change the package name.
