/* 

The length of a string can be obtained using the method public int length() of the String class.

For Example:
"Pentagon".length() returns 8.
The characters in a string are indexed from 0, just like in an array. The method public char charAt(int index) returns the char value at the specified index. An index ranges from 0 to length() - 1. The first char value of the string is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on, as for array indexing.

If we want to convert a string to lowercase, we should use public String toLowerCase() method. It returns a new string that has all the characters of the original string in lower case. Similarly, we have a public String toUpperCase() method for converting to upper case.

Retype the code below which demonstrates the usage of the above methods.

Note: Please don't change the package name.
