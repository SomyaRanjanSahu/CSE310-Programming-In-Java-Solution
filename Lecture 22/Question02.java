/* 

Write a class CompareArrays with a public method compare that takes two parameters arr1 and arr2 of type int[] find the difference between the corresponding arr1 and arr2 elements and returns the count of elements whose difference is less than 2 and greater than -2. The return type of compare should be int.

Assumptions:
arr1 and arr2 never will null
arr1 and arr2 have same length
Here is an example:
Enter no of elements in the arr1:
3
Enter elements in the arr1 seperated by space:
1 2 3
Enter no of elements in the arr2:
3
Enter elements in the arr2 seperated by space:
2 3 4
3


Note: Please don't change the package name.
