/* 

Write a class MultiplesInArray with a public method findMultiples that takes three parameters arr of type int[] and other two are m1 and m2 are of type int. Print all the elements in the array, but if any element in the array is a multiple of m1, print multiple of (actual value of m1 should be printed instead of ). If it is a multiple of m2, print multiple of . If it is a multiple of both m1 and m2, print multiple of m1 and m2.

For example:
Enter no of elements in the array:
6
Enter elements in the array separated by space:
1 2 34 5 6 7
Enter the first multiple element:
2
Enter the second multiple element:
3
1
2 is multiple of 2
34 is multiple of 2
5
6 is multiple of 2 and 3
7




Note: Please don't change the package name.
