/* 

Write a class SequenceOfEvens with a public method checkEvenSequence that takes one parameter arr of type int[] and returns true if three consecutive even numbers are present in the arr. The return type of checkEvenSequence is boolean.

Assumptions:
arr is never null
Here is an example:
Enter no of elements in the array:
4
Enter elements in the array seperated by space:
2 4 6 5
true
