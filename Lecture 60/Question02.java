/* 

Dictionary is an abstract class which represents key-value pairs like the Map interface.

Hashtable is a concrete implementation of Dictionary class.

NOTE: Dictionary class is obsolete. New implementations should implement the Map interface, rather than extending Dictionary class.

With the release of Java 2 platform (i.e version 1.2), Hashtable class is retrofitted to implement the Map interface. However, it is generally recommended that we use HashMap in place of Hashtable.

For all practical purposes a HashMap and a Hashtable are same, except that HashMap allows null values and a null key, while Hashtable does not allow nulls for keys and values. We will learn about the other difference with regards to synchronization when we learn about multi-threading.

Note: Please don't change the package name.
