/* 

The Queue interface in collection hierarchy represents a real-world queue (meaning a line of waiting people or vehicles).

In the above statement, attention should be paid to the word waiting.

Let us consider some people standing in queue at a movie ticket counter. The person who enters the queue first gets a chance to buy the tickets first. While the person in the front of the queue is being served, the remaining persons are waiting.

In programming, we use a Queue to store elements which usually need to be processed in the order they have been inserted into the Queue, i.e: first-in-first-out (FIFO).

There are special queue implementations which do not always follow the first-in-first-out (FIFO) concept, for example PriorityQueue and DelayQueue.

Apart from the methods inherited from the Collection interface, Queue interface provides some special methods like :
offer(E element) - used to insert elements into a Queue
poll() - used to retrieve and remove the element at the head/front of the Queue
peek() - used to retrieve and not remove the element at the head/front of the Queue

The Deque interface extends Queue.

A Deque represents a double ended queue, which facilitates addition and removal from both ends.

ArrayDeque class is a concrete implementation of Deque interface. Which means that whenever we want a simple queue or a double-ended queue implementation we can use an instance of ArrayDeque.

ArrayDeque does not permit null elements. It is recommended to be used as a replacement for the java.util.Stack and java.util.LinkedList as it is much faster than both of them.

See and retype the below code which demonstrates the usage of ArrayDeque as a queue as a stack and as a double ended queue.

Note: Please don't change the package name.
