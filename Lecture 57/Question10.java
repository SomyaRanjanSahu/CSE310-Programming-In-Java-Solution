/* 

Write a program to understand how to insert and get elements into an ArrayList using the add and get methods .

Create a class ListDemo with a main method. Create an instance of ArrayList and add days of week from Sunday through Saturday to the list and print the same, also get the element at index 3 and print the result

The result should be as follows:
[Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday]
The element at the given index is Wednesday


Note: complete the code between the comments:
// write your code below this 

// write your code above this

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Notice the use of generics. We will learn more about them later.
		// The type parameter <String> will ensure that your code cannot add any 
		// other object than those of type String

		// write your code below this
