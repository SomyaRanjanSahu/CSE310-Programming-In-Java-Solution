/* 

The java.time package introduced in Java 8 contains many new classes apart from replacements for the existing Date, DateFormat and Calendar classes.

For a complete list of new classes in java.time package click here.

Below are list of a few important classes:
Instant - represents a moment on the time-scale. Unlike the java.util.Date which measures till milliseconds, an Instant records even nanoseconds.
LocalDate - represents a date without the time component
LocalTime - represents a time without the date component
LocalDateTime - represents an object with both date and time components
ZonedDateTime - represents a complete date-time object with time-zone
See and retype the below code.

Note: Please don't change the package name.
