/* 

A Map represents a collection of key-value pairs.

In a Map one key is mapped to at most one value.

Map does not allow duplicate keys, but the values can be duplicated.

Below are some of the concrete classes which implement Map interface:
HashMap - most commonly used class whenever we want to store key mapped with values (the order of iteration over the entries is not guaranteed to be the same as the insertion order).
TreeMap - is used when we want the key-value entries to be sorted on the natural ordering of its keys, or by a custom Comparator
LinkedHashMap - is used when we want the retrieval of key-value entries to be in the order in which they were inserted or in the order in which they were last accessed.
The most commonly used methods in Map interface are given below:
put(K key, V value) - stores the key and value mapping. If the key already exists, the old value will be replaced with the newly provided value and the old value will be returned.
get(Object key) - returns the value mapped to the given key.
remove(Object key) - removes the key-value mapping if such a mapping exists and returns the value mapped to the key. It returns null, if there is no mapping for the given key.
size() - returns the count of key-value pairs present.
keySet() - returns a Set containing only the keys in this map.
putAll(Map m) - stores all the the key and value mapping in the given map m.
