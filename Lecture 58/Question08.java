/* 

The LinkedHashMap is a subclass of HashMap.

Unlike a HashMap which does not maintain order of the added entries, a LinkedHashMap orders the entries in their insertion order by default.

A LinkedHashMap also has a special constructor LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor, boolean accessOrder) which creates a map whose order of iteration will be the order in which its entries were last accessed, i.e the order will be from least-recently accessed to most-recently accessed.

Fill the missing code in the below program. You will notice that the entries in the LinkedHashMap always maintain their insertion order.



Note: Please don't change the package name.
