IO stands for input and output. The java.io package has classes which help us read input from sources and write output to destinations.

These sources and destinations can be files, sockets or input and output streams of other processes.

Java makes IO programming very easy with its extensive classes distributed mainly in two packages java.io and java.nio.file.

We will first learn about the classes which deal with files and file systems in the java.nio.file package and later we will visit the classes which deal with IO streams present in the java.io package.

File system is the one responsible for storing and retrieving data from a storage. File systems usually store the data in files and directories in a hierarchical structure (tree structure).

The starting point for such a hierarchy is called a root node.

Linux, Unix and other Unix-like operating systems use / (forward slash) to denote the root node (there is no name, it is called the root or slash).

Microsoft Windows allows for multiple root nodes which are also called as drivers (C:\, D:\ etc ).

Data is stored in named entities called files. These files are grouped under other type of named entities called directories or folders.

A directory can have files and other directories which are called subdirectories of the current parent directory.

The location of a file or a directory in a file system is called path.

There are two types of paths - absolute and relative. For example :
Unix and Unix-like	Microsoft Windows
/home/user/abc.txt	C:\home\user\abc.txt
The above two are examples of absolute paths because they specify the location of a file named abc.txt from the root nodes in their respective operation systems.

A relative path does not include the root node and can represent a file name or a directory name or a portion of an absolute path without the root node.

For example, relative paths from the above absolute path can be any of the following:
Unix and Unix-like	Microsoft Windows
home/user/abc.txt	\home\user\abc.txt
home/user	home\user
home	home
user	user
user/abc.txt	user\abc.txt
abc.txt	abc.txt
// java.nio.file package contains a class called Path which models the above said path of a file or a directory.

Please note that a Path object is only a representation of a location. It does not mean that a file or a directory must exist at that path.

// java.nio.file package also contains a utility class called Files which contains static methods for creating, deleting and manipulating files and directories represented by a Path object.

// See and retype the below code. Please note that we need to import java.nio.file package to work with the above two classes and we need to import java.io package for IOException.

Note: Please don't change the package name.
