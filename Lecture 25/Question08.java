/* 

The state information of an instance of Student class is stored in its instance fields.

These fields are usually marked as private.

These fields are initialized using the constructor. Hence, after the values are initialized, getXXX and setXXX methods are written to retrieve and modify their values.

A setXXX method is called a setter method. For a field named age, the setter method would be written as:
public void setAge(int age) {
 	this.age = age;
}
A getXXX method is called a getter method. For a field named age, the getter method would be written as:
public int getAge() {
 	return age;
}
These getter and setter methods are also called as accessor methods.

Note how the getter and setter method names follow camel-case naming convention.

See and retype the below code.

Note: Please don't change the package name
