/* 

The toString() method like the constructor of a class is part of the class body. It must be written inside a class scope (inside the opening and closing brace of the class).

Hint: You can select some code and press ALT + Up key or ALT + Down key to move the selected code up and down. (Note: This works only in Windows and not in MAC and Linux)

Identify and correct the error.

Note: Please don't change the package name
