/* 

Factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted by n!. It is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Write a class FactorialCalculator with a public method factorial. The method receives one parameter n of type int. Fill in the missing code in the below program to calculate the factorial of a given number and print the output.

For example:
Cmd Args: 4
Factorial of 4 = 24
Hint: You can use the integer variable factorial initialized to 1, to store the computed factorial value. You can write a for loop which iterates from 2 to n multiplying the loop counter in each iteration with factorial and storing the product again in factorial.

Note: Please don't change the package name.
