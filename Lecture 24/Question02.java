/* 

In a class if the name of the constructor is different from the name of the class, Java treats it as a different method.

Press Submit to see compilation error and then correct the error.

[Hint: Java is case sensitive, meaning change in the case of characters will make it a different name.]

Note: Please don't change the package name.
