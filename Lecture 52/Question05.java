/* 

Daemon thread is a low priority thread (in the context of JVM) that runs in background to perform tasks such as garbage collection etc., they do not prevent the JVM from exiting when all the user threads finish their execution.

JVM terminates itself when all user threads finish their execution, even while Daemon threads are running.

The code Thread.currentThread().isDaemon() will return true, if the current thread is a daemon thread and false if it is not a daemon thread.

Write a Java program to illustrate daemon threads.

Write a class DeamonThreadDemo which extends the Thread class. Override its run() method to check whether the current thread is either daemon or user thread and print "This is daemon thread" and "This is not a daemon thread" respectively.

Write the main() method in the class DeamonThreadDemo, which create three instances of class DaemonThreadDemo as t1, t2 and t3 and perform the below tasks in the given order:
invoke the setDaemon() method on t1 instance and pass true as the argument to set t1 as a daemon thread.
Invoke start() method on t1, t2 and t3 respectively.


Note: Please don't change the package name.
