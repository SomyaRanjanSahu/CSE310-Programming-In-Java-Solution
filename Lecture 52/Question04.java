/* 

Write a Java program to demonstrate the usage of isAlive() and join() methods in threads.

Write a class JoinThreadDemo with a main() method that creates and executes two instances of Counter class which implements Runnable interface.

Let the Counter class take a String argument name and let its run() method print that message for 10 times along with the current count as given below:
System.out.println(name + " : " + i);
The JoinThreadDemo.main() method should perform the below tasks in the given order :
Create the first instance of thread as t1 with an instance of Counter class using "Spain" as the argument.
Create the second instance of thread as t2 with an instance of Counter class using "UAE" as the argument.
Print the isAlive() status of t1 as : "t1 before start t1.isAlive() : " + t1.isAlive().
Print the isAlive() status of t1 as : "t2 before start t2.isAlive() : " + t2.isAlive().
Start t1 and t2 threads respectively.
Print a message to the console as : "started t1 and t2 threads".
Print the isAlive() status of t1 as : "t1 after start t1.isAlive() : " + t1.isAlive().
Invoke the join() method on t2.
Print the isAlive() status of t1 as : "t2 after start t2.isAlive() : " + t2.isAlive().


Note: Please don't change the package name.
