/* 

Write a Java program that uses three threads to perform the below actions:
First thread should print "Good morning" for every 1 second for 2 times
Second thread should print "Hello" for every 1 seconds for 2 times
Third thread should print "Welcome" for every 3 seconds for 1 times
Write appropriate constructor in the Printer class which implements Runnable interface to take three arguments : message, delay and count of types String, int and int respectively.

Write code in the Printer.run() method to print the message with appropriate delay and for number of times mentioned in count.

Write a class called ThreadDemo with the main() method which instantiates and executes three instances of the above mentioned Printer class as threads to produce the desired output.

[Note: If you want to sleep for 2 seconds you should call Thread.sleep(2000); as the Thread.sleep(...) method takes milliseconds as argument.]

Note: Please don't change the package name.
