/* 

Suppose we have a string that contains a list of comma separated items like, "Apples, Oranges, Peaches, Bananas". We want to split the string extract all the items into an array. String class provides a method for doing this, called public String[] split(String regex).

The above string can be split using split method like this :
"Apples, Oranges, Peaches, Bananas".split(","). 
It returns an array containing the items in the list. 
When we print the array, it prints the following:
Apples
 Oranges
 Peaches
 Bananas
Note the extra space before each item (except Apples).
The argument for the split method should be a regular expression. You will learn about using regular expressions in Java in some other section.

Retype the code below that demonstrates the usage of split method.

Note: Please don't change the package name.
