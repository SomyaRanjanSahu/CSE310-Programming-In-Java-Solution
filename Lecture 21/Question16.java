/* 

Write a class SequenceCount with a public method sequenceCount that takes one parameter arr of type int[] and returns the count of sequences present in the arr. The return type of sequenceCount should be int.

Assumptions:
arr is never null
arr may contain zero or more sequences
A sequence is defined as a combination of three numbers in continuous sequence which are of values: 1x, 2x, 3x.

Here are some examples for your understanding:
Cmd Args : 9 7 3 6 9
1
Cmd Args : 2 6 8 2 1
0
Cmd Args : 10 20 30 1 2 3
2


Note: Please don't change the package name.
