/* 

Write a class SumOfArrays with a public method sum that takes two parameters arr1 and arr2 are of type int[] and returns the sum of arr1 and arr2 elements in to the third array.

Assumptions:
arr1 and arr2 will never null
arr1 and arr2 are of same length
Here is an example:
Enter no of elements in the arr1:
3
Enter elements in the arr1 seperated by space:
1 2 3
Enter no of elements in the arr2:
3
Enter elements in the arr2 seperated by space:
4 5 6
5
7
9


Note: Please don't change the package name.
