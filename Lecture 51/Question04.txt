Read the code below:
void waitForSignal() throws InterruptedException {
    Object obj = new Object();
    synchronized (Thread.currentThread()) {
        obj.wait();
        obj.notify();
     }
}
Which statement is true?
Executing the code results in InterruptedException.
The code throws IllegalMonitorStateException.
The code throws a TimeoutException after ten minutes.
Reversing the order of obj.wait() and obj.notify() might cause this method to complete normally.
A call to notify() or notifyAll() from another thread might cause this method to complete normally.
This code does NOT compile unless "obj.wait()" is replaced with "((Thread)obj).wait()".

Ans :-

The code throws IllegalMonitorStateException.
